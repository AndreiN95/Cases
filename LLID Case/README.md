## HHKB Style Case

The case from [this IC thread](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=78701.100) about a case compatible with a normal plate, but still having blockers.

This is the CAD file, and while a 3D print would be very close to accurate, I want a fully machined prototype before moving to production.

Update: production of a full aluminum case on a Tormach is a no-go.
Massdrop hasn't gotten back to me after round 1 prototypes, but they look quite nice.
Minor issues with perpendicularity in screw mounting.
