## Lil 38

![RIP Stanford Art Admissions](https://i.imgur.com/lceMX7Z.png)

The Lil 38 is the first keyboard I created, with a 5x3 main matrix, and 4 thumb keys.
It is the product of a summer of research and development on ergonomics.
The layout forms the basis for the CamelDox, 20key, and 36+12 with its aggressive stagger.
The tenting allows for infinite adjustability, and repeatable connections through simple screws.

Unlikely to go to GB in it's current form, will probably go as plus10 or plus12,
(PCB supported versions of 20key and 36+12).

This is sort of my legacy board, never really been used, but the basis of all my designs.
