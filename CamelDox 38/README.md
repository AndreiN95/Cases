# CamelDox 38

A branch of the Lil' 38, but just one part case.  
It uses the same plates as the Lil' 38, but uses a "batwing" or "butterfly" style case.

## Parts
* 3/8" (9mm) Acrylic for High Profile
* 3/8" (9mm) equivalent thickness Acrylic for Middles
* 1/8" (3mm) Acrylic for Bottom
* Acrylic Cement
* 10 #6 screws (short)
* 3  #6 screws (at least 1/2" long)

## Assembly
The cutout is sized for a Teensy LC, but a Pro Micro or Teensy 2.0 should fit as well.  
It would be good to double check measures before you get the parts cut.
I used acrylic cement to glue the middles and bottom together, and just avoided the middle three screws.
Two options are 3 pieces of 1/8" (3mm) acrylic, or one piece of 3/8" (9mm).
The middles fit tightly enough around the plates that it holds the board together.
The smaller holes in the acrylic should be tapped.
Those are the 10 holes around the key matrices in the high profile, and the 3 in center of the middles.
It would be best to glue the middles before you tap them, but not attach the bottom yet.

This might be incomplete, it was written up at like 1am.  Pls send halp.
