## Key Switches - ALPS/MX Sliders

![Spinny giffy](http://i.imgur.com/E2NOPkg.gifv)

Slider replacement to let ALPS switches support MX mount keycaps.  
Supports bumpers for silencing.
Works on Matias switches (where I got the measurements), and the other white ALPS I've tried.


Tentative working name is SRT.

Another person has a GB out as of January 2018, these have been put on hold.

But SLA 3D printed versions do work, with a few minor tolerancing problems at large scale (~70 at a time).
