## 20Key

![Colors w/ keycaps](https://i.imgur.com/qHeq9nl.png)

These are the files for a variant of the Lil 38 with one more thumb key, and a different case profile.

There are plates that are designed to be 3D printed.  They have a small lip to support the switch and a deeper pocket for the body to rest in.
They should be oriented so that the small lip is against the bed.
They have holes to be used for tenting.  These might need to be tapped post printing.


##### Update Jan 2018:

New case files have been added.  There exist two version on this repo, but both have the exact key placement.
The old files ("Printables") do not have a case attached, and printing them will leave wiring exposed.  For tenting, these must be tapped with a 1/4-20 tap for screw tenting.
The new files (R/L platecase and bottom) are designed to be used together.  They have a full enclosed case.  The bottoms can also be cut from 3mm acrylic.  They are the same across the R/L case, so print or cut out two.

The new case has a rectangular cutout for the Pro Micro's USB port, and a circluar hole for TRRS connector.  It was designed for [this panel mount connector.](https://www.jameco.com/z/PJ31640-3-5mm-4-Conductor-TRRS-Panel-Mount-Phone-Jack_2201607.html)

The new files have also been updated to use magnetic tenting.  You'll want all the screws, nuts, and washers from the Assembly Counting sheet in the Minidox folder, along with [these ring magnets](https://www.kjmagnetics.com/proddetail.asp?prod=R841).  You'll need 6 for both sides of the case.

##### Update March 2018:

PCB is in the works, ramping up for a group buy with all the bells and whistles like magneto tenting, hi-profile case,
and maybe HDPE and aluminum cases. Photo at top is of the newest version with QSA caps for rendering.
