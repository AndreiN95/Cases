These are the files for a variant of the Lil 38 with one more thumb key, and a different case profile.

There are plates that are designed to be 3D printed.  They have a small lip to support the switch and a deeper pocket for the body to rest in.
They should be oriented so that the small lip is against the bed.
They have holes to be used for tenting.  These might need to be tapped post printing.
