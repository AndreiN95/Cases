##Sandwich Style Case

At the request of /u/BALTHAZ4R, a solution desinged to integrate with the existing Acrylic cases.  According to IC specs, these are to be cut from 0.157" acrylic.
From there, they need to be tapped with a 1/4-20 tap.  These can usually be found at hardware stores, and a cheap hand tap will work great for acrylic. 
Be sure to connect the case together before you tap, otherwise the threads might not be aligned, and you won't be able to thread the bolt through.
