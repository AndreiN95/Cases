##ErgoDox Tenting Files

These contain two designs, both of which utilize three 1/4-20 screws to adjust the height and tilt of the board.
Using these screws, nearly any angle and height can be achieved.

The files included are STEP for every piece, STL for 3D printables, and DXF for laser cutting.
The Top and Bottom Cases could be 3D printed, or machined from a metal/plastic.
The LCD window/cover is designed to be laser cut out of 0.079" thick acrylic.  It will work to have it thicker, it just will not be level with the rest of the case.

####Locking in Screw height

To lock screw height, just add 2 1/4-20 nuts on the screw, right before the threaded hole on the case.  Tighten both nuts against the case.

When you remove the screw, leave the nuts snugged against each other.  That way, they will hold the position that the screw should go to.
