Bunch of CAD files of designs of Dotdash32 on Reddit and Geekhack

This is full of all the files that I've made in order to create the following designs:

* Lil' 38 Split Keyboard
* ErgoDox Infinity Tenting
* LLID HHKB style case
* 20 Key Modification of Lil' 38
* Keycap profile designs


All these files are under the GNU General Public License (GPL).  Use it how you like, but please mention where you got the files, both for my fragile ego and so others can find the original files if they want to make their own modifications.
