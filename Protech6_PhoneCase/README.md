## Adaptable Phone Case

A phone case with expandable back attachments.

For Engineering 27, a group of 5 students created a phone case for an iPhone 7+ that has an adapter on the back to mount various accessories.
Sample attachments are a laser pointer and money clip.
A full set of toleranced and dimenionsed working drawings are included, as well as STP files of the main components.


### Developing
A hardware API is included for developing other attachments.
Its drawing is included separately as well as in the compiled drawings file.
The basic form is layered 1/16in acrylic cemented together with a .25in hole drilled in the center for alignment.
A magnet should be placed into the small hole and glued in place to help with aligment.





### Polyjet 3D printing
For printing the money clip, MainClip and MainClipText can be imported into a multimaterial printer to more visibly see the text.

The case is printed in a 50-50 split rigid flex, and has a elongation of approximately 50%.  Originally, our group full flexible material and full rigid material, as well as a blend with 25% stretch, all which did not meet our design criteria.
